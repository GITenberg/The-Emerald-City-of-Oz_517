description: "The Emerald City of Oz is the sixth of L. Frank Baum's fourteen Land\
  \ of Oz books. It was also adapted into a Canadian animated film in 1987. Originally\
  \ published on July 20, 1910, it is the story of Dorothy Gale and her Uncle Henry\
  \ and Aunt Em coming to live in Oz permanently. While they are toured through the\
  \ Quadling Country, the Nome King is assembling allies for an invasion of Oz. This\
  \ is the first time in the Oz series that Baum made use of double plots for one\
  \ of the books.\nBaum had intended to cease writing Oz stories with this book, but\
  \ financial pressures prompted him to write and publish The Patchwork Girl of Oz,\
  \ with seven other Oz books to follow.\nThe book was dedicated to \"Her Royal Highness\
  \ Cynthia II of Syracuse\" â€” actually the daughter (born in the previous year, 1909)\
  \ of the author's younger brother, Henry Clay \"Harry\" Baum.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
